snake game in javascript
warning: definitely has bugs when changing things

functions so far
-game.start()

-game.stop()

-game.setSnakeSize(value)
this is % so 0<value<=50

-setGameSpeed(value)
the time it takes for the snake to move once, smaller value->faster speed

-setContainerWidth(value)
-setContainerHeght(value)
again this is % so is should be between 0 and 100

-game.setTailColor(value)
the value should be a string (ex: "red", not red); also works with hexadecimal (ex: "#ffffff")
